ECS639 Group Coursework: Development of a basic E-commerce website 

Group: Three students 
Mark: 15% 
Deadline: End of week 11 (Friday 24 March) 

Description: 

Develop a basic E-commerce website using the Django framework. The product which is sold on the website is left for you to decide. The site should provide the following basic functionalities:  

1.    Users can create a personal account and are able to login and logout. 
2.    The user’s account should contain at least name, email, phone and address. 
3.    Once logged in users can browse and/or search for the different items available. The user can add some of these items to a shopping basket. 
4.    The user should be able to view the shopping basket, and amend the order by either deleting an item, or changing the quantities required for each item. 
5.     Upon checkout the user should receive an email conOirmation detailing the order that was placed (no payment system is required). 
6.   Once the checkout has been performed, the user’s shopping basket should be emptied. If the user hasn’t checked out, however, the contents of the shopping basket should be remembered even if a user logs out (and closes the browser) and logs in again.  

Outcome: 

Once fully tested, your application should be deployed to the school’s openshift web servers (to be discussed in week 10). Each group should submit the code together with a one-page report describing any extra features that go beyond the minimal requirements above. Submit these as a single zip Oile. Remember to include in the report the URL of your deployed application, and the username and password for the admin page. 

Marking criteria: 

1. Application meets the basic requirements and is deployed on openshift. [5%]

2.  Code is well-written and appropriately commented, Django/python features fully explored. [5%] 
  
3.  Extra features included, and report succinctly and clearly explains these features. [5%] 

Examples of extra features: 

1.   Use of MySQL instead of Sqlite 
2.   Use of Ajax 
3.   Use of other frontend technologies such as Bootstrap or AngularJS 
4.  Inclusion of a Web or REST API
